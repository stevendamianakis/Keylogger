# Red Team
**A description of how red team can perform such an attack.**

From an MITRE ATT&CK perspective, the installation and use of keyloggers are often associated with the "Credential Access" tactic. Specifically, the "Keystroke Logging" technique involves capturing user input to obtain credentials and other sensitive information. The installation guide provides detailed instructions for downloading, compiling, and running the keylogger, as well as information on how to modify it to include additional functionality and hide it from detection.

Attackers can use the information provided in the file and associated repository to install and use keyloggers on Linux systems, as well as to modify them to include additional functionality and evade detection. Adversaries may also use the information to develop new, more sophisticated keyloggers that are more difficult to detect and remove.

To use the information to attack others, adversaries may take the following steps:

- Download and compile the keylogger according to the instructions provided in the installation guide.
- Modify the keylogger to include additional functionality, such as email reporting or remote access capabilities.
- Use anti-debugging techniques and other methods to hide the keylogger from detection.
- Distribute the modified keylogger to potential victims, either through social engineering or other means.
- Collect and exfiltrate sensitive information obtained through the keylogger, such as usernames, passwords, and other authentication tokens.
